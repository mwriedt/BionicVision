To fit phosphenes within the screen based on the conversion algorithm we have
used (degrees to pixel coordinates), the minimum excepted degree is (1, 1).
The midpoint is approxmiately (58, 62) where the former describes the
horizontal degrees and the latter defines vertical degrees. Maximum accepted
coordinates that appear on screen are (73, 75).
